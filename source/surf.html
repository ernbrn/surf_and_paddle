<div class= "bio">
  Hi, I'm Annie! I'm fun-loving dolphin living on the beautiful coast of North Carolina.
  I'm passionate about swimming, surfing (recently!), sushi, sailing, and snorkeling. You
  can find me most days catching some waves in the sun, or deep sea diving looking for shells.
  I love working and blogging for Surf and Paddle Co.!

   <div class= "toptext">Today was super exciting. After learning how to talk last week, I didn't think that anything
   as exciting could possibly happen to me. Well boy was I wrong! Today I learned how to surf! Eeep eeep eeeee-ee-e
 eeep! That's dolphin for "I had the best time". You might think, hey Annie, you're a dolphin, isn't your regular
mode of traveling through the ocean pretty similar to surfing, if not ten times better and faster? That's a great
question, and what I have to say to you is if there's anything more awesome than catching a great wave out there with your
surfing buddies, it's a surfing dolphin. Not to say I'm in it for the publicity, but this new skill of mine has the
potential to bring in some good side money eventually. Before I start to focus on that, I'm working hard with my awesome
trainers here at Surf and Paddle Co. to really get my technique down. These certified trainers have what it takes to
teach me how to catch the best waves in all sorts of circumstances. If they can teach a dolphin to surf, they can teach
you to surf!</div>

<div class="toptext"> Here's how the whole thing started. I was chilling in the warm ocean on another beautiful North
  Carolina day hanging out with the surfing professionals. I was hopping around in the great waves some of the surfers
  were catching, when Dave had the idea that I should hop on a board. Turns out, perhaps unsuprisingly, I have a knack
  for the sport! I'm going to finish up this post in my native tongue. Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh hhehhhh. Eeep
  eeeeehp. Eeep. EEEEEEEp! Eeeeeep. Ehepp! Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh hhehhhh. Eeep eeeeehp. Eeep. EEEEEEEp! Eeeep.
  Eeeeeep. Ehepp! Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh hhehhhh. Eeepeeeeehp. Eeep. EEEEEEEp! Eeeeeep. Ehepp! Eepeppepepp.
  Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh hhehhhh. Eeepeeeeehp. Eeep. EEEEEEEp! Eeeeeep. Ehepp! Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh
  hhehhhh. Eeepeeeeehp. Eeep. EEEEEEEp! Eeeeeep. Ehepp! Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh hhehhhh. Eeep eeeeehp. Eeep.
  EEEEEEEp! Eeeeeep. Ehepp! Eeeeee-ehepp eeh eeee ehehhehhh hhehhhh. Eeepeeeeehp. Eeep. EEEEEEEp! Eeeeeep. Ehepp!<br>
  Talk to y'all soon!<br>
